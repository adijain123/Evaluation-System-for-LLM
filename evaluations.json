        "question": "What is LLM?",
        "user_answer": "LLM can refer to several things, but I'll cover the most common meanings:\n\n1. **Large Language Model**: In natural language processing (NLP), a Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that is trained on a massive corpus of text data. These models use neural networks to generate human-like language, answering questions, completing sentences, and even creating text based on a given prompt. Examples of LLMs include models like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet.\n2. **Limited Liability Member**: In business and law, LLM can refer to a type of business structure where a member has limited liability, meaning their personal assets are protected in case the business incurs debts or liabilities.\n3. **Law Library of Congress**: The Law Library of Congress (LLM) is a research library within the United States Congress, providing access to a vast collection of law-related materials, including books, journals, and online resources.\n4. **Learning Management System**: In education, LLM can refer to a Learning Management System, which is a software platform used to create, deliver, and manage online courses, training programs, and educational content.\n\nWithout more context, it's difficult to determine which meaning is most relevant. If you have any additional information or clarification, I'd be happy to provide more specific details!",

        "reference_answer": "CFCs stands for Chlorofluorocarbons. They are a group of synthetic compounds that were widely used as refrigerants, propellants, and solvents in various industrial and consumer products.\n\nCFCs were first developed in the early 20th century and became popular in the mid-20th century due to their non-toxic, non-flammable, and non-reactive properties. They were used in a wide range of applications, including:\n\n1. Refrigeration: CFCs were used as refrigerants in air conditioners, refrigerators, and freezers.\n2. Propellants: CFCs were used as propellants in aerosol cans, such as hairspray, deodorant, and spray paint.\n3. Solvents: CFCs were used as solvents in cleaning products, such as degreasers and dry cleaning fluids.\n4. Blowing agents: CFCs were used as blowing agents in the production of foam insulation and other foam products.\n\nHowever, CFCs have a significant environmental impact. When released into the atmosphere, CFCs contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This depletion of the ozone layer allows more UV radiation to reach the Earth's surface, leading to increased rates of skin cancer, cataracts, and other health problems.\n\nIn 1987, the Montreal Protocol was signed by countries around the world to phase out the production and consumption of CFCs. The treaty aims to protect the ozone layer by reducing the release of CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances.\n\nSome common types of CFCs include:\n\n* CFC-11 (trichlorofluoromethane)\n* CFC-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane)\n* CFC-113 (1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane)\n* CFC-114 (1,2-dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane)\n\nToday, CFCs are being replaced by alternative substances, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), which have a lower global warming potential and do not contribute to ozone depletion.",
